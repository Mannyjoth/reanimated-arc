# Reanimated Arc

This is an animated Arc component implemented with `react-native-reanimated`. It can be used to create circular progress bars, donut charts, and many more... all with native performance.

## Special Thanks

Special thanks to [Lenus eHealth](https://www.lenusehealth.com/) for their openness to sharing solutions, that was created during the project time, with the open-source community.

Library was inspired by `https://github.com/bartgryszko/react-native-circular-progress` and some math behind generating arc was taken directly from that repo. Also big thanks for the authors.
